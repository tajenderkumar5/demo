# The Art of Writing Maintainable Code

Software engineering is as much about communication as it is about computation. A codebase tells a story, and that story must be legible to humans across teams and time.

## Naming Things

People often say that naming things is one of the hardest problems in computer science. Good names are compressions of meaning. They help readers load context quickly and reduce cognitive overhead.

When you choose a name, prefer clarity over cleverness. Avoid abbreviations that only insiders understand. Let variable names explain the why, not just the what.

## Functions and Abstractions

Functions are the verbs of your codebase. They should do one thing and do it well. When functions grow too large, split them into smaller units with focused responsibilities.

Abstractions should hide accidental complexity while exposing essential intent. Over-abstraction can be as harmful as under-abstraction. Aim for the simplest design that works.

## Comments and Documentation

Comments should explain why code exists, not restate the obvious. Use docstrings to share intent and guide future maintainers. Documentation is not a luxuryâ€”it's part of the product.

## Testing and Tooling

Tests are a form of empathy for your future self and your teammates. Good tests give you the courage to refactor. Tooling like linters and formatters keep the codebase consistent and friendly.
